//Javascript operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations


/*
Types of JavaScript Operators
There are different types of JavaScript operators:

Arithmetic Operators
Assignment Operators
Comparison Operators
String Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Ternary Operators
Type Operators
*/

/*
1.arithmatic ope(arith the progrstion)



Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement



2.assigment(assign the value )


Operato
=
+=
-=	
*=	
/=	
%=	
**=	


3.comparision (compare the values different)


Operator
==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator

4. logical (Logical operators in JavaScript are used to combine multiple conditions and return a single true or false result.)


Operator
&&	logical and
||	logical or
!	logical not

5.type operator()
Typeof in JavaScript is an operator used for type checking and returns the data type of the operand passed to it. T


Operator	
typeof	=Returns the type of a variable
instanceof=	Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

6.bitwaise (
Bitwise operators in JavaScript operate on 32-bit operands.

)

7.string (
JavaScript String Operators are used to manipulate and perform operations on strings)

8.ternary
he conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands:
 a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ),
  then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : )
, and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.
